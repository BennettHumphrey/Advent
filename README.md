# Artists Advent

A coding challenge my friend sent me.  
I had no idea what to fill the 25 days with, so I figured I would use this as an opportunity to learn a bit about art.  

## Usage

-Cards are available based on the current date (no matter the month).  
-The current date can be changed in the top left with the "+" and "-".  
-By default all cards from 1 to the current date are available

## Launching locally

-To launch locally simply clone, and run npm run dev in the terminal

## Deploying online

-Depends on where you want to deploy.  
-Follow instructions here: https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html

## Challenges encountered

-This was one of my first times working with Sanity, so that was a bit tricky. 
-Adding images with Sanity was harder than I expected, but not too bad when I figured it out.  
-This is also my first time writing anything in markdown, though that was just a quick google.  
-For some reason I couldn't get variables to work with grid using Tailwind, and I spent way too long trying to fix that before I just resorted to simple React inline styles. See what I mean in Card.jsx, line 33.  

## Possible improvements

-The Sanity content could be a bit more interesting.  
-I'm sure the color scheme could be improved upon.  
-Maybe some code could be made more efficient?
